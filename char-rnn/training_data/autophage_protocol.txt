The Autophage Protocol: Metabolic Economics for Decentralized Health  Austin Harshberger  1@0x42r.io  July 14, 2025  Abstract  Traditional economics assumes value persists indefinitely, enabling unlimited wealth accumu- lation. Living systems operate differently because value requires continuous renewal or it ceases to exist. This paper introduces the Autophage Protocol, a system that combines formal incen- tive design with cryptographic privacy guarantees, linking tokenized health rewards to verifiable activity while maintaining a strict separation of identity and data. Four token species decay at rates calibrated to biological persistence. Rhythm (5% daily) for exercise, Healing (0.75%) for therapy, Foundation (0.1%) for preventive care, and Catalyst (2–10% dynamic) for marketplace balance. Decayed tokens flow to The Reservoir, funding community healthcare while preserving privacy through zero-knowledge proofs.   Mathematical modeling suggests wealth distribution converges to a Gini coefficient of 0.08–0.11 under baseline conditions, and remains below 0.55 even when 23% of the population acts adversarially 1 , far more equitable than traditional sys- tems at 0.82 or higher [6, 22]. The protocol represents a new economic primitive where money must move to exist, creating a digital economy with metabolism-like properties.

This fundamental property of traditional economics creates systemic inequality and health in- centive failures. A dollar earned decades ago maintains its nominal value indefinitely. Bitcoin [24] stored in 2009 remains unchanged today.   This permanence rewards accumulation over activity, creating economies where wealth concentrates among those who already possess it while those who need resources most must continuously labor for finite rewards. The Autophage Protocol challenges this foundational assumption by creating tokens that decay exponentially without continuous health activity.   The name Autophage, meaning “self-eating,” mirrors the essential dynamic in that value must consume itself to persist, preventing indefinite accumulation while rewarding ongoing engagement. The protocol implements four interconnected novelties.   First, it creates multiple token species with decay rates precisely calibrated to match the temporal persistence of their underlying health activities.   Exercise tokens decay rapidly like cardiovascular fitness, while preventive care tokens persist longer like vaccine immunity.   Second, it achieves cryptographic privacy separation through zero-knowledge proofs, enabling health ver- ification without surveillance.   Third, it derives token value from measurable metabolic energy expenditure rather than speculative markets.   Fourth, it implements empirical governance where all protocol changes must demonstrate statistically significant health improvements through on- chain experiments. These mechanisms work together to create an economy that mimics biological systems. Analo- gous to how organisms require continuous energy input to maintain homeostasis, protocol partici- pants must engage in verified health activities to maintain token balances. The following sections present the complete mathematical framework, implementation archi- tecture, and empirical validation of this metabolic economic system.   Each component has been designed to align financial incentives with biological imperatives, creating a digital economy that enhances rather than exploits human health.  2   Related Work  In the early 20th century, Silvio Gesell proposed “stamped scrip” to force currency to circulate by making it expire, an approach he tested in W¨ orgl, Austria during the Great Depression [11]. These experiments gained traction under local government support, but collapsed as soon as legal enforcement lapsed. The main lesson being demurrage alone does not guarantee a stable or resilient economy, especially when external incentives favor stasis. Cryptocurrency inherited some of this thinking. Freicoin, launched in 2013, introduced decay by subtracting a fixed demurrage fee from every balance at regular intervals [10]. While technically functional, Freicoin’s approach was blunt, with no connection to user behavior or economic context. As a result, activity and participation dwindled, and the protocol failed to build lasting network effects or meaningfully incentivize healthy engagement. Other “health coins” have focused on rewards for activity, using move-to-earn or similar models. Most are marketplace tokens, structured around accumulation. STEP’N [17] pays users for walking, but value is driven by speculative tokenomics, not by any durable health metric. The project saw rapid growth but struggled to maintain sustainable rewards.   Sweatcoin uses a similar approach. Users earn points for steps and spend them in a marketplace, but the system lacks decay mechanics, biological calibration, and any link to real health persistence. 4The Autophage Protocol diverges on three counts.   First, it ties decay rates directly to the half-life of underlying health activities, making token persistence a function of biological process instead of arbitrary policy. Second, it separates identity from data using zero-knowledge proofs, so participation does not require surveillance. Third, it requires every protocol change to demonstrate measurable health improvement on-chain before implementation. Where earlier systems enforced circulation by decree, Autophage encodes it at the metabolic and behavioral level.  Navigating Sections 3–10  The following sections, from three to ten, are focused primarily on formalized mathematical rep- resentations of the protocol. For readers less interested in academic rigor, it is advisable to focus only on the various Examples in each section, as they are written more plainly. The core compo- nents covered in each section, but not in the Examples, are also summarized in Appendix A–D.For those interested in learning how to translate the mathematics from Sections 3–10, start by reading Appendix E.  3   Metabolic Token Dynamics  3.1   Mathematical Foundation  The protocol implements a four-species token ecosystem where each species exhibits distinct decay characteristics matching its health domain. Let   S   =   { Rhythm ,   Healing ,   Foundation ,   Catalyst }  denote the set of token species. For any user   u   at discrete time   t , the balance   V   ( u )  i   ( t ) of species   i   ∈   S   evolves according to:  V   ( u )  i   ( t   + 1) =   V   ( u )  i   ( t )(1   −   δ i ) +   G ( u )  i   ( t )   (1) where   δ i   ∈   (0 ,   1) represents the daily decay rate and   G ( u )  i   ( t ) represents newly generated tokens from verified health activities. The continuous-time differential equation underlying this discrete implementation is:  dV dt   =   − λV   +   g ( t )   (2) where   λ   =   −   ln(1   −   δ ) is the continuous decay constant.   This formulation ensures mathematical consistency while enabling computationally efficient blockchain implementation. Table 1: Token Species Parameters and Biological Justification  Species   Decay Rate   Half-Life   Health Domain   Biological Basis  Rhythm   5%   13.51 days   Exercise, medication   VO 2   max decline rate [23] Healing   0.75%   92.42 days   Therapy, recovery   Neuroplasticity timescales [16] Foundation   0.1%   693.15 days   Preventive care   Antibody persistence [3] Catalyst   2–10%   Variable   Marketplace   Self-regulating 5The half-life calculations follow directly from exponential decay:  t 1 / 2   =   ln(0 . 5) ln(1   −   δ i )  =  ln(2)  λ i  (3)  Example 3.1:   Consider Sarah who runs daily, earning 50 Rhythm tokens per run. After main- taining a balance of 1,000 tokens, she stops running for two weeks. Her balance evolution follows:  Day   Formula   Balance  0   Initial   1,000 tokens 7   1 ,   000   ×   0 . 95 7   696 tokens 14   1 ,   000   ×   0 . 95 14   488 tokens This 51.2% loss over two weeks mirrors the documented decline in cardiovascular fitness during training cessation [23], validating the biological calibration.  3.2   Token Generation Mechanics  Health activities generate tokens through a multi-factor reward system:  G ( u )  i   ( t ) =   X  j ∈A i  B i,j   ×   M   ( u,j )  total   ( t )   ×   1 [activity   j   verified]   (4) where   A i   represents activities mapped to species   i ,   B i,j   is the base reward for activity   j , and   M total  combines multiple multipliers:  M total   =   M streak   ×   M group   ×   M time   ×   M genetic   ×   M synergy   ×   M quality   (5) subject to the constraint 0 . 3   ≤   M total   ≤   20 to prevent exploitation while rewarding performance. The streak multiplier follows a logarithmic function:  M streak   = 1 + log 10 (consecutive days)   (6) The circadian multiplier uses a sinusoidal function:  M time   = 1 + 0 . 3 sin     2 π ( h   −   6) 24    (7) where   h   is the hour of day in 24-hour format.  Example 3.2:   Marcus completes his morning workout routine:  Component   Calculation   Value  Base reward   Standard rate   35 Rhythm tokens 30-day streak multiplier   1 + log 10 (30)   2.48 6 AM circadian bonus   1 + 0 . 3 sin(2 π (6   −   6) / 24)   1.3 Group workout   Standard group bonus   1.5  Total generation   35   ×   2 . 48   ×   1 . 3   ×   1 . 5   169 tokens  6− 10   0   10   20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90   100  0  20  40  60  80  100  t 1 / 2 =13.5d   t 1 / 2 =92.4d  Days  Remaining Value (%)  Rhythm (5% daily)  Healing (0.75% daily)  Foundation (0.1% daily)  Figure 1:   Comparative decay curves showing differential value persistence across token species. Rhythm tokens model rapid fitness loss, Healing tokens reflect gradual therapeutic progress decay, and Foundation tokens represent long-term health investments.  3.3   Advanced Decay Mechanics  The protocol implements progressive decay acceleration for large balances to prevent wealth con- centration:  δ ef f i   ( V   ) =   δ i   ×   1 +  n X  k =1  α k   ×   1 [ V > τ k ]  !  (8) where   τ k   represents tier thresholds and   α k   represents acceleration factors. For continuous acceleration above soft cap:  δ ef f i   ( V   ) =   δ i   ×    1 +   β   ×   max    0 ,  V   −   τ sof t  τ sof t   γ     (9) where   β   controls sensitivity (typically 0.5-2.0) and   γ   shapes the acceleration curve (typically 1.0- 1.5).  Example 3.3:   Consider whale protection for Rhythm tokens:  Balance Range   Decay Rate   Acceleration   Daily Loss (75K example)  ≤   10,000   5%   Standard   - 10,001–50,000   7.5%   50%   - 50,001–100,000   10%   100%   7,500 tokens  >   100,000   15%   200%   - A user holding 75,000 Rhythm tokens loses 7,500 daily instead of 3,750 under standard decay, creating natural redistribution pressure. 73.4   Catalyst Token Dynamics  Catalyst tokens function as the protocol’s liquidity and governance utility, enabling marketplace transactions, proposal staking, and price discovery through metabolic pricing.   They are earned through verified activity, subject to dynamic decay, and cannot be vaulted or used for long-term savings. Catalyst tokens maintain ecosystem balance through dynamic decay adjustment:  δ catalyst ( t ) =   δ base   ×    1 +   β   ×   V catalyst ( t )  P  i ∈ S   V i ( t )   −   ρ target  γ     (10) where   ρ target   = 0 . 25 represents the target 25% supply ratio,   β   = 2 controls sensitivity, and   γ   = 1 . 5 shapes the response curve.  Example 3.4:   When Catalyst tokens comprise 40% of total supply:  δ catalyst   = 0 . 02   ×    1 + 2   × | 0 . 40   −   0 . 25 | 1 . 5    (11) = 0 . 02   ×   (1 + 2   ×   0 . 058)   (12) = 0 . 0232 (2.32% daily decay)   (13) This 16% increase in decay rate gradually returns the system to equilibrium without shock.  4   The Reservoir: Dual-Chamber Architecture  4.1   System Architecture  The Reservoir serves as the protocol’s metabolic center, collecting value from natural decay and re- distributing it for community health. Its dual-chamber design separates token flows from stablecoin reserves:  R token ( t   + 1) =   R token ( t ) +   X  i,u  δ i V   ( u )  i   ( t )  |   {z   }  decay inflow  −   W health ( t )  |   {z   }  health claims  −   W reward ( t )  |   {z   }  rewards  (14)  R U SDC   ( t   + 1) =   R U SDC   ( t ) +   F market ( t ) +   F app ( t )  |   {z   }  fee inflows  −   H settle ( t )  |   {z   }  healthcare settlements  (15) The solvency constraint ensures healthcare access remains guaranteed:  R U SDC   ( t )   ≥   max   0 . 4   X  u  D u ( t ) ,   3   ×   ¯ H monthly ,   0 . 22   ×   Y annual  !  (16) This triple-coverage requirement protects against bank runs, seasonal variations, and catastrophic events. 8Example 4.1:   System snapshot at 100,000 active users:  Metric   Value  Daily token decay   500,000 tokens (5/user avg) Monthly healthcare settlements   $ 800,000 Annual revenue   $ 4,800,000 Required USDC reserve   $ 2,400,000 Reserve calculation   max( $ 1.6M,   $ 2.4M,   $ 1.056M) The 3-month coverage requirement dominates, ensuring the system can weather extended stress periods.

V market ( t ) captures the 30-day rolling marketplace volume in USDC.   S active ( t ) denotes the circulating supply excluding vaulted tokens.   V   ( t ) measures token velocity with a target range of 10-30 monthly transactions.   C ratio ( t ) indicates the proportion of Catalyst tokens in the system.   γ   serves as the energy gradient parameter, typically ranging from 1.2 to 3.0. Finally,   M activity ( t ) reflects the system-wide activity level. 10Example 5.1:   Price calculation during typical conditions:  Parameter   Value  Daily health energy   500,000 kcal Standardized energy value   $ 0.002 per kcal Monthly marketplace volume   $ 150,000 Active supply   10 million tokens Current velocity   15x monthly Catalyst ratio   0.23 Activity multiplier   1.4 Energy gradient   2.0  P   ( t ) =  (500 ,   000   ×   0 . 002)   ×   (1 + 2 . 0   ×   0 . 23) + (150 ,   000 / 30)   ×   (1   −   0 . 23) 10 ,   000 ,   000   ×   (15 / 30)   ×   (1 + 1 . 4)   (21) =  1 ,   000   ×   1 . 46 + 5 ,   000   ×   0 . 77 5 ,   000 ,   000   ×   2 . 4   (22) =  1 ,   460 + 3 ,   850 12 ,   000 ,   000   (23) = $0 . 000442 per token   (24)  5.2   Energy Cost Calibration  Each activity’s energy cost encompasses multiple factors:  E activity   =   T duration   ×   W wage   +   C metabolic   ×   F f ood   +   O opportunity   +   E equipment   (25)  Example 5.2:   45-minute therapy session energy calculation:  Cost Component   Calculation   Amount  Time cost   0.75 hours   × $ 30/hour   $ 22.50 Emotional energy   200 kcal-equivalent   × $ 0.002   $ 0.40 Transportation   Fixed cost   $ 5.00 Opportunity cost   Estimated value   $ 10.00  Total energy cost   Sum of components   $ 37.90  This establishes the baseline value for Healing token generation from therapy activities.  6   Privacy Architecture  6.1   Zero-Knowledge Identity Separation  The protocol achieves complete separation between identity and health data through nested cryp- tographic commitments [14, 13]:  P rof ileID   =   H ( H ( U serID || Salt 1 ) || Salt 2 || Secret )   (26) 11This double-hashing with independent salts provides 768 bits of entropy, making correlation attacks computationally infeasible even with quantum advances.  Example 6.1:   Privacy preservation in practice:  Component   Value  Alice’s UserID   alice@email.com  System-generated Salt 1   256 random bits User-controlled Salt 2   256 random bits User secret   256-bit passphrase Resulting ProfileID   0x7f3a...9b2e   (indistinguishable from random) Even if an attacker compromises the system database and obtains Salt 1 , they cannot correlate ProfileIDs without also obtaining user-controlled Salt 2   and Secret values.  6.2   Privacy-Preserving Marketplace  The marketplace implements granular privacy controls with explicit economic incentives: Table 2: Privacy Tiers and Economic Premiums  Tier   Information Revealed   Base Price   Typical Premium  Anonymous   Activity type, timestamp   $ 100   Baseline ProfileID   + Consistency metrics, streak data   $ 100   75% ( $ 175) Genetic   + Specialized traits, optimizations   $ 100   250% ( $ 350) Full   + Historical patterns, correlations   $ 100   500% ( $ 600)  Example 6.2:   Sarah’s marathon proof monetization:  Privacy Tier Information Revealed   Sale Price  Anonymous   “Sub-4:30 marathon, major city, female 25–34”   $ 100 ProfileID   Same   +   “180-day   running   streak,   3 marathons/year”  $ 175 Genetic   Same + “Endurance Elite trait, VO 2   optimiza- tion”  $ 350 Buyers value additional information for research, motivation, or verification purposes while Sarah maintains control over disclosure levels.  6.3   Zero-Knowledge Proof Generation  Health activities undergo privacy-preserving verification [13]:  π   = Prove ( C   = Commit( activity, r ) ,   Statement , witness )   (27) where the statement proves properties without revealing underlying data. 12Example 6.3:   Therapy session verification:  Data Type   Details  Private data   Therapist name, location, session notes, diagnosis codes Public statement   “Completed 50-minute therapy session on 2025-07-07” Proof   π   Cryptographic evidence statement is true Token generation   80 Healing tokens Revealed information   None beyond the public statement  7   Biological Scaling Laws  7.1   Kleiber’s Law Implementation  Metabolic efficiency scales with network size following quarter-power scaling [15]:  η ( N   ) = 1 +   α   ×     N N 0   0 . 25  (28) where   α   = 0 . 3 and   N 0   = 1 ,   000 (reference network size).  Example 7.1:   Network scaling benefits:  Network Size   Scaling Calculation   η   Value   Bonus  1,000   1 + 0 . 3   ×   1   1.30   30% 10,000   1 + 0 . 3   ×   1 . 78   1.53   53% 100,000   1 + 0 . 3   ×   3 . 16   1.95   95% 1,000,000   1 + 0 . 3   ×   5 . 62   2.69   169% Larger networks provide efficiency benefits to all participants, mimicking biological metabolic scal- ing.  7.2   Liebig’s Law of the Minimum  System health limited by weakest component triggers automatic rebalancing [19]:  H system   = min( H users , H reserves , H apps , H geographic , H velocity )   (29) When any component falls below threshold   θ   = 0 . 7:  M bottleneck   = 1 +   κ   ×   ( θ   −   H min )   (30) 13Example 7.2:   Geographic bottleneck response:  Metric   Urban   Rural  Participation rate   85%   45% Health threshold   70%   70% Status   Healthy   Below threshold Bottleneck calculation   -   M   = 1 + 2   ×   (0 . 7   −   0 . 45) = 1 . 5 Token bonus   Standard   50% bonus  7.3   Additional Biological Laws  The protocol implements five additional scaling laws: 1.   Allee Effect   [2]: Small population support  M Allee   =        2 . 0   N <   500 1 . 5   500   ≤   N <   1000 1 . 0   N   ≥   1000 (31) 2.   Circadian Rhythms : Time-optimized rewards  M circadian ( h ) = 1 +   A   ×   sin     2 π ( h   −   ϕ ) 24    (32)  where   A   = 0 . 3 and   ϕ   = 6 (6 AM peak)  3.   Bergmann’s Rule   [5]: Environmental adaptation  R target   =   R base   ×   (1 +   σ   ×   H environment )   (33) 4.   Optimal Foraging   [18]: Activity recommendation  ROI activity   =   T okens   ×   (1   −   δ ) t hold  Energy cost  (34) 5.

Dimin- ishing returns reduce the value of each subsequent trait by 10%. The total cost is 9,750 Foundation tokens for a combined multiplier of 1.274.  8   Economic Analysis  8.1   Wealth Distribution Dynamics  Monte Carlo simulations 2   across 10,000 users for 365 days show that the protocol actively converges to broad equality. In baseline (honest) conditions, the Gini coefficient falls from 0.11 (day 30) to 0.08 by day 365 maintaining that after a year, the   typical user   is almost as well-off as their peers, and the bottom 50% holds meaningful wealth (see table). For context, the same simulation run with Bitcoin-style rules produces Gini values above 0.88, and “fiat” simulations stabilize around 0.56.  2 All results and source code available at   https://autophage.xyz/gini-simulation .  150   50   100   150   200   250   300   350   400  0 . 2  0 . 4  0 . 6  0 . 8  Target (honest)  Adversarial   < 0.55  Days  Gini Coefficient  Autophage (baseline)  Autophage (adversarial, 23%)  Bitcoin  US Dollar  Figure 3:   Gini coefficient evolution over one year (10,000 users, 0.7 activity rate).   Autophage Protocol converges to 0.08–0.11 in honest conditions and resists adversarial attacks up to 0.55 (with 23% of users acting against the system; see Appendix H). Traditional economies and Bitcoin remain above 0.80.  Example 8.1:   Wealth distribution after one year (mean of 10 simulation runs):  Population Segment   Autophage (baseline)   Autophage (adversarial)   Bitcoin  Top 10% wealth share   15%   32%   78% Bottom 50% wealth share   37%   16%   2% Median user balance   650–820 tokens   210–270   Variable Max sustainable balance   ∼ 18,000 tokens   ∼ 34,000   Unlimited Final Gini   0.08–0.11   0.54–0.55   > 0.88 Even under sustained, adversarial attack from almost a quarter of the network (including coor- dinated Sybil swarms and collusion pools), the protocol refuses to become a winner-take-all system. Inequality rises, but never approaches the levels endemic to fiat or crypto. And when the network is honest, almost everyone ends up close to the mean.  8.2   Revenue Model and Unit Economics  The protocol generates sustainable revenue through three main streams: 16Table 3: Revenue Streams and Contribution Margins  Revenue Stream   Per User/Month   Margin   Annual at 1M Users  App Integration Fees   $ 0.15   95%   $ 1.8M Marketplace Fees (12%)   $ 0.45   88%   $ 5.4M Enterprise Verification   $ 1.25   92%   $ 15.0M  Total   $ 1.85   91.7%   $ 22.2M Example 8.2:   Break-even analysis:  Cost Component   Amount  Fixed costs (monthly)   $ 30,000* Variable cost per user   $ 0.15/month Revenue per user   $ 1.85/month Contribution margin   $ 1.70/month Break-even users   17,647  Projected timeline   Month 8–10 This table summarizes the core unit economics of the protocol, showing that a monthly fixed cost of   $ 30,000 and a variable cost of   $ 0.15 per user are offset by   $ 1.85 in monthly revenue per user, resulting in a break-even point at 17,647 users.   3  9   Empirical Governance  9.1   Contribution-Based Voting  Traditional token-weighted voting fails when tokens decay. The protocol implements contribution scoring inspired by commons governance principles [25]:  C score   =   w 1   ×   log 10 (1 +   R lif etime ) +   w 2   ×   V reputation   +   w 3   ×   A participation   (40) where   w 1   = 0 . 5,   w 2   = 0 . 3,   w 3   = 0 . 2.  Example 9.1:   Voting power calculation:  User   Lifetime Tokens   Accuracy   Active   Score   Voting Power  Alice   50,000   95%   80%   2.80   1.67 Bob   5,000   70%   40%   2.14   1.46 Score calculation: Alice achieves a score of 0 . 5   ×   log 10 (50 ,   001) + 0 . 3   ×   0 . 95 + 0 . 2   ×   0 . 80 = 2 . 80, while Bob’s score is 0 . 5   ×   log 10 (5 ,   001) + 0 . 3   ×   0 . 70 + 0 . 2   ×   0 . 40 = 2 . 14.  3 All economic analysis and results are available at   https://autophage.xyz/economic-simulations . Fixed costs are set at   $ 30,000 for demonstration only. Actual costs will vary depending on whether cloud or physical infrastructure is used, among other factors.  179.2   On-Chain Experimentation  All protocol changes require empirical validation: Success =     μ treatment   −   μ control  μ control  ≥   ϵ    ∧   ( p < α )   (41) where   ϵ   = 0 . 05 (5% improvement) and   α   = 0 . 05 (statistical significance).  Example 9.2:   Seasonal affective multiplier proposal:  Experiment Parameter   Value  Hypothesis   2x winter rewards increase activity Stake required   500 Catalyst tokens Test group size   5,000 random users Control group size   5,000 random users Duration   30 days  Results  Control average   12.3 activities/month Treatment average   15.8 activities/month Improvement   28.5% p-value   0.0012 Outcome   Proposal passes Reward   Stake returned + 100 USDC bonus  9.3   Gas Optimization Strategies  Efficient implementation enables scalability: 1.   Lazy Decay : Calculate only on interaction. This optimization saves approximately 17,000 gas per unused day through storage optimization using a single timestamp per user-species pair. 4  2.   Batch Processing : Aggregate multiple proofs with batch sizes up to 100 proofs, achieving 85% gas reduction compared to individual transactions through Merkle tree root submission for verification. 3.   State Channels : Off-chain accumulation with daily settlement frequency, reducing on-chain transactions by 95% through Lightning-style payment channels for micropayments.  Example 10.2:   Gas cost comparison:  Verification Method   Calculation   Monthly Gas  Individual daily   65,000 gas   ×   30   1,950,000 gas Batched weekly   120,000 gas   ×   4   480,000 gas  Savings   75% reduction in gas costs  4 Empirical gas measurements were conducted using Ethereum mainnet test contracts for both naive decay and optimized “lazy decay” storage logic.   The 17,000 gas savings is calculated as the difference in gas usage between recalculating and updating all balances on each block versus the optimized approach, which applies decay only on interaction. See full benchmarking code and methodology at   https://autophage.xyz/gas-optimization .  1810   Implementation Architecture  10.1   Core Smart Contracts  The protocol consists of four primary contracts with specific responsibilities   5 : 1.   AutophageToken : Multi-species token with lazy decay evaluation  function balanceOf(address user, uint8 species) returns (uint256) { uint256 timeSince = block.timestamp - lastUpdate[user][species]; uint256 decayFactor = (PRECISION - decayRate[species]) ** timeSince; return balance[user][species] * decayFactor / (PRECISION ** timeSince); }  2.   ReservoirContract : Dual-chamber treasury management  function processHealthcareClaim(Claim memory claim) { require(usdcBalance >= claim.amount, "Insufficient reserves"); uint256 priority = calculatePriority(claim); priorityQueue.insert(claim, priority); processPriorityQueue(); }  3.   VerificationEngine : zkVM proof processing  function verifyAndMint(Proof memory proof, uint8 species) { require(zkVerifier.verify(proof), "Invalid proof"); uint256 amount = calculateReward(proof, species); tokenContract.mint(msg.sender, species, amount); }  4.   GovernanceContract : Experiment management  function evaluateProposal(uint256 proposalId) { Proposal memory p = proposals[proposalId]; (uint256 improvement, uint256 pValue) = calculateResults(p); if (improvement >= MIN_IMPROVEMENT && pValue < ALPHA) { implementProposal(p); returnStakeWithBonus(p.proposer); } }  5 Each of the prospective smart contracts is viewable at   https://autophage.xyz/smart-contracts . These con- tracts are experimental and so are intended solely for demonstration purposes.  1911   Limitations and Future Work  11.1   Technical Limitations  Several constraints affect current implementation. Most notably, proof-generation overhead remains a significant challenge because, on mobile devices, modern zero-knowledge systems such as Groth16, Aurora, and Zexe [13, 4, 7] can take tens of seconds to generate a proof (and sometimes over a minute for complex circuits), while more optimized toolchains and smaller circuits may complete in 1–2 seconds [26]. This performance bottleneck limits user experience and complicates real-time verification. Additionally, cross-chain fragmentation introduces complexity, as each blockchain environment demands a separate deployment and maintenance cycle, hindering seamless interoperability across ecosystems.   Regulatory uncertainty further complicates matters; health token classification and compliance requirements vary by jurisdiction, making global rollout an ongoing challenge. Beyond technical and legal constraints, behavioral inertia is perhaps the most stubborn evi- denced by prior experiments with demurrage currencies consistently revealing user resistance to the very idea of “disappearing money” [11, 10].   As a result, there is a clear need for careful behavioral design and user education in any system based on token decay.  12   Conclusion  The Autophage Protocol demonstrates that economic systems can theoretically implement biologi- cal principles to create more equitable and health-promoting outcomes. By introducing mandatory token decay calibrated to health activity persistence, the protocol creates an economy where value must flow to exist, preventing the pathological accumulation that characterizes traditional monetary systems. The mathematical framework suggests several promising properties. First, wealth distribution would likely converge to Gini coefficients [12] between 0.08 and 0.11 based on Monte Carlo simu- lations [1], compared to 0.82 for fiat currencies and 0.88 for Bitcoin. 6   This would occur through fundamental mechanics rather than redistribution or taxation.   Second, the endogenous pricing model ties value directly to health effort, making speculation unprofitable while rewarding genuine wellness activities. Third, the privacy architecture enables verification without surveillance, solving a decades-old tension in public health monitoring. The theoretical model indicates the protocol could achieve break-even at approximately 17,000 users with 91.7% contribution margins. The dual-chamber Reservoir design should maintain health- care settlement guarantees even under extreme stress scenarios. The empirical governance system would enable continuous optimization based on statistically significant health improvements. Perhaps most significantly, the protocol exists as a complete alternative to permanent-value economics. Where Bitcoin [24] provides digital gold and Ethereum [8] enables programmable con- tracts, the Autophage Protocol introduces digital metabolism. These three primitives, geological permanence, computational flexibility, and biological persistence, together could form a complete foundation for human-centric digital economies.  6 Under adversarial conditions (23% of users acting adversarially), Gini remains capped below 0.55; see Appendix H for simulation details.  2013   Works Consulted References  [1] 0x42 Research.

Catalyst Tokens  Fourth token species with dynamic 2–10% decay maintaining 25% ecosystem balance through automatic adjustment.   Catalyst tokens are earned through marketplace participation and protocol activity, used for staking, governance proposals, and price discovery tied to metabolic pricing. They cannot be vaulted or saved.  Circadian Multiplier  Time-of-day reward adjustment following natural biological rhythms, maximizing at 6 AM (1.3x) and minimizing at 6 PM (0.7x).  Contribution Score  Governance weight calculated from lifetime Reservoir contributions, reputation, and partici- pation rather than current holdings.  Decay Rate ( δ )  Daily percentage of token value lost, ranging from 0.1% (Foundation) to 5% (Rhythm) based on activity persistence.  Dual-Chamber Reservoir  Community treasury architecture separating decaying tokens from USDC reserves to ensure healthcare liquidity.  Endogenous Price  Value determined by internal health activity energy costs rather than external market spec- ulation.  Foundation Tokens  Slowest-decaying species (0.1% daily) earned through preventive care and long-term health investments.  Genetic Adaptation  System allowing users to burn Foundation tokens for permanent earning traits, creating spe- cialized economic profiles.  Gini Coefficient  A statistical measure of how wealth is distributed in a system.   Zero means everyone holds the same amount, while one means a single participant holds everything. In this protocol, a lower Gini coefficient signals that value is circulating widely.   Most national currencies and cryptocurrencies show Gini values above 0.80.  Half-Life  Time required for token balance to reduce by 50% without renewal; 13.51 days for Rhythm, 92.42 for Healing, 693 for Foundation.  Healing Tokens  Token species with 0.75% daily decay earned through therapy, recovery, and mental health activities. 25Kleiber’s Law  Biological scaling law implemented as   η ( N   ) = 1 + 0 . 3( N/ 1000) 0 . 25 , increasing efficiency with network size.  Liebig’s Law  Principle that system health equals its weakest component, triggering automatic reward re- balancing.  Metabolic Pricing  Price discovery based on actual energy expenditure (time, calories, opportunity cost) of health activities.  ProfileID  Cryptographic identifier with 768-bit entropy separating user identity from health activity data.  Proof of Temporal Persistence (PoTP)  Core protocol mechanism requiring continuous activity to maintain value, preventing passive accumulation.  Rhythm Tokens  Fastest-decaying species (5% daily) earned through exercise, medication adherence, and daily health habits.  Soft Cap  Balance threshold triggering accelerated decay to prevent excessive accumulation while al- lowing reasonable savings.  USDC  Dollar-pegged stablecoin issued by Circle and Coinbase. Used as a programmatic, fully-backed USD equivalent for on-chain settlements.  Wellness Vault  Time-locked token storage with reduced decay rates enabling targeted healthcare saving.  Zero-Knowledge Proof  Cryptographic method verifying health activities without revealing personal data, maintain- ing privacy.  zkVM Orchestration  Application layer managing proof generation across heterogeneous health apps while preserv- ing privacy. 26C   Selected Use Case Examples  The following use cases are hypothetical. Each user journey is designed to show how the protocol works in practice. No story describes a real person or actual event. These are demonstrations of what is possible with the Autophage Protocol.  C.1   Marathon Training: Sarah’s Journey  Sarah, a 29-year-old software engineer, uses the protocol to fund her gender-affirming surgery while training for marathons. Her daily routine generates multiple token streams: Morning runs earn 50–75 Rhythm tokens depending on distance and intensity. Her 30-day streak multiplier has grown to 2.48x, while her “Early Bird” genetic trait adds 15% for pre-7 AM activi- ties. Weekly therapy sessions generate 80 Healing tokens each, with her “Mental Resilience” trait providing an additional 12% bonus. Her Chicago Marathon completion created particularly valuable proof:  Reward Component   Value   Tokens  Base marathon reward   Standard   200 Foundation Sub-4:30 time bonus   1.5x multiplier   Applied Perfect weather penalty   0.9x   Applied  Total generation   200   ×   1.5   ×   0.9   270 Foundation  The zero-knowledge proof included timing chip data, GPS traces, heart rate patterns, and photo- graphic evidence, compressed into a verifiable statement: “Female 25–34 completed major marathon in 4:27:33.” She listed this anonymously for   $ 300, receiving   $ 264 after fees. Current progress toward   $ 4,000 surgery goal:  Income Source   Amount  Token value   $ 2,847 Proof sales   $ 1,584 Monthly average   $ 132 Months to goal   3.5 Sarah’s public ProfileID has attracted a following among trans athletes. While her gender identity remains private, her consistent performance inspires others facing similar journeys.  C.2   Recovery Economics: Marcus’s Story  Marcus discovered the protocol on day 387 of sobriety. While physical fitness remained challenging, his daily recovery meetings became an economic foundation. Each meeting generates 40 Healing tokens, with milestones providing substantial bonuses: 27Milestone   Token Bonus  30 days continuous   300 tokens 90 days   900 tokens 1 year   3,000 tokens 18 months   4,500 tokens His genetic evolution focused on recovery optimization:  Trait   Benefit   Bonus   Cost  Recovery Resilience   General recovery bonus   15%   1,000 Foundation Social Connection   Group activity bonus   12%   2,500 Foundation Consistency Rewards   Streak bonus   10%   5,000 Foundation Healing Focus   Healing token bonus   20%   10,000 Foundation Combined multipliers mean his daily meetings now generate 72 tokens instead of the base 40. His 12,000 Healing token balance represents   $ 8,040 in value, providing financial security that supports sustained recovery. Marcus monetizes his journey selectively.   Anonymous daily proofs sell for   $ 2-3 to researchers studying recovery patterns. His one-year sobriety proof sold for   $ 100. Monthly proof sales generate  $ 180 supplemental income, funding gym membership and therapy co-pays. The economic visibility of recovery has transformed his self-perception. “My sobriety has measur- able value,” he tells newcomers.   “Every day clean creates wealth for myself and data that helps others.”  C.3   Creator Economy: Luna’s Empire  Luna leverages the protocol to differentiate her 850K subscriber OnlyFans empire. Unlike competi- tors relying on photo editing and claims, she provides cryptographically verified fitness achieve- ments. Her daily routine becomes multi-stream content: Morning workout routine:  Component   Multiplier   Value  Base reward   -   50 Rhythm tokens 6 AM circadian bonus   1.3x   Applied Livestream multiplier   1.5x   200+ viewers Performance Aesthetics trait   15%   Applied Camera Ready trait   12%   Applied  Total generation   Combined   115 Rhythm tokens  Every activity generates both tokens and content. Post-workout biometrics create Foundation tokens while providing transparency her audience craves. Meal prep earns tokens while teaching nutrition. Even rest days generate Healing tokens through documented recovery practices. 28Her proof monetization strategy:  Proof Type   Individual Price   Bundle/Package  Daily workout   $ 5   $ 100/month Transformation   -   $ 200 (90-day) Personal records   $ 50-500   Varies by achievement Genetic trait revelation   $ 1,000   One-time With 17,000 proof subscribers paying   $ 200/month average, Luna generates   $ 3.4M monthly from verification alone. The protocol’s 12% marketplace fees seem minimal compared to the trust pre- mium her verification commands.  D   Plain Language Summary  Traditional money persists indefinitely.   A dollar earned decades ago maintains its value without effort.   This permanence creates economies where wealth concentrates among those who already possess it, while those who need resources most must continuously labor for finite rewards.   The Autophage Protocol introduces a fundamental alternative through money that decays. The protocol creates four species of digital tokens, each calibrated to match the persistence of different health activities.   Exercise tokens decay at five percent daily, reflecting how quickly cardiovascular fitness deteriorates without maintenance.   Therapy tokens decay at three-quarters of one percent daily, mirroring the gradual erosion of mental health progress.   Preventive care tokens decay at one-tenth of one percent daily, representing the long-term nature of vaccinations and screenings. A fourth species, Catalyst tokens, maintains ecosystem balance through dynamic decay rates. Every token must be earned through verified health activity. Running generates Rhythm tokens. Therapy sessions produce Healing tokens. Annual checkups create Foundation tokens. The system rewards consistency through multipliers where morning workouts earn circadian bonuses, group activities multiply rewards, and sustained streaks compound earnings.   Users who exercise daily maintain steady balances, while inactive users watch their balances decrease. Decayed tokens flow to The Reservoir, a dual-chamber treasury at the protocol’s heart.   One chamber collects expired tokens and redistributes them as rewards for new activities.   The other maintains stablecoin reserves to settle real healthcare expenses.   This architecture ensures that individual decay creates collective wealth, funding community health infrastructure through the natural expiration of unused value. Privacy remains absolute through cryptographic separation. The system verifies that you ex- ercised without revealing when, where, or how. Users control their disclosure level, from complete anonymity to selective revelation of patterns that command premium prices in health data mar- kets. Researchers purchase aggregated proofs to study behavior patterns. Insurers adjust premiums based on verified activities. Individuals monetize their consistency without sacrificing privacy. 29The protocol implements biological scaling laws throughout.   Network effects follow Kleiber’s Law, increasing efficiency as the ecosystem grows.   Bottlenecks trigger automatic rebalancing through Liebig’s Law.   Small communities receive enhanced support through Allee Effect multi- pliers. Every mechanism derives from observed biological systems rather than economic theory. Users adapt their economic metabolism through genetic traits, using Foundation tokens to evolve permanent earning multipliers.   Wellness vaults enable targeted saving by reducing decay rates for locked tokens. Progressive decay acceleration prevents extreme accumulation. Empirical governance requires all changes to demonstrate measurable health improvements through on-chain experiments. The result transforms economics from a system of accumulation to one of circulation. Wealth flows or disappears. Health activities generate immediate value. Privacy and transparency coexist through mathematics.   The Autophage Protocol experiment poses a fundamental question:   can an economy modeled on living systems create more equitable and sustainable outcomes than one modeled on geological permanence?  E   Understanding the Math for Everyone  This appendix explains the paper’s formal notation so that any motivated reader can understand what is being described. Mathematics serves two purposes in this protocol. It makes rules unam- biguous and repeatable, and it allows anyone to verify or critique the system’s logic without relying on trust or marketing claims.  Mathematical Symbols in Context  Table 5: Common Mathematical Symbols in the Autophage Protocol  Symbol   Meaning   Example Use  δ   Decay rate, the fraction of value lost per period   δ   = 0 . 05 means 5% daily decay  λ   Growth or scaling rate (context-dependent)   λ   may set user onboarding pace P   Summation, sum all values in a range   P n i =1   x i   means add   x 1   to   x n  γ   Sensitivity or acceleration parameter   γ   increases effect in adaptive decay  i, j, u   Indices for species, activities, or users   V   ( u )  i   is species   i   for user   u  ( t )   Value at time   t   G ( u )  i   ( t ) means reward at time   t  | x |   Absolute value, distance from zero   |− 3 |   = 3  ( u )   Superscript shows the user   u   V   ( u )   is value for user   u  Why These Symbols? A Brief History and Rationale  Many of the mathematical symbols used here have a long history, appearing in physics, biology, and economics: 30Table 6: Historical and Disciplinary Context of Core Mathematical Symbols  Symbol   Origins & Common Uses   Why Used Here  δ   Greek letter delta.   Used for small changes or decay (calcu- lus, physics, biology). Represents   decay   rates   for   token value,   mirroring biological loss or depreciation.  λ   Greek   letter   lambda.   De- notes   growth   rates,   eigen- values   (math,   ecology,   eco- nomics). Captures   system   growth,   arrival rates, or user inflow; signals scaling or tempo.  P   Uppercase   sigma.   Ancient Greek,   adopted   in   18th- century math.   Standard for summing   sequences   (statis- tics, physics, economics). Indicates summing over activities, users, or token classes; fundamental to reward calculations.  γ   Greek   letter   gamma.   Used for rates of change, sensitivity, and scaling (physics,   econo- metrics). Adjusts the strength or “sharpness” of   protocol   effects   (such   as   how quickly penalties accelerate).  How to Read the Equations Aloud  Here are examples of how to say these formulas out loud, and how to “translate” notation to spoken language:  Example 1: Token Balance Evolution  V   ( u )  i   ( t   + 1) =   V   ( u )  i   ( t )(1   −   δ i ) +   G ( u )  i   ( t ) Read aloud: “V sub i, superscript u, at time t plus one, equals V sub i, superscript u, at time t, times one minus delta sub i, plus G sub i, superscript u, at time t.” In plain English, this means: “The balance for user u, token species i, tomorrow, equals today’s balance after decay, plus the new tokens earned.”  Example 2: Adaptive Catalyst Decay  δ catalyst ( t ) =   δ base   ×    1 +   β   ×   V catalyst ( t )  P  i ∈ S   V i ( t )   −   ρ target  γ     Read aloud: “Delta sub catalyst at time t equals delta base times the quantity one plus beta times the absolute value of the ratio of V catalyst at t over the sum from i in S of V sub i at t, minus rho target, all raised to the power gamma.” For clarity:  •   “Sub” means the subscript (the variable after the underscore).  •   “Superscript” (or “to the power”) means the small number or letter above the main symbol.  •   P n i =1   x i   is read “the sum from i equals one to n of x sub i.”  •   Greek letters are read by name: “delta,” “lambda,” “gamma,” “rho.” 31No mathematical symbol in this paper is used for gatekeeping. The explicit notation is necessary for precision and trust.   Each equation can be seen as a technical contract between the protocol and its users. If anything is unclear, these tables provide a reference for decoding the symbols, and every formula can be read aloud, checked in simulation, or translated into code. In short, the math is here so anyone can follow the logic, test the claims, and keep the system honest.  F   Note from the Author  Biomimetics, if it means anything, is enforcement rather than metaphor. In Autophage, decay is structural. Value dies if it does not circulate. Most systems treat nature as garnish; here, mortality is code. Accumulation outside of health savings is a liability. The status quo rewards stasis and calls it success.   In health and in money, what survives is what moves. Everything else is just afterlife accounting. – The Autophage Protocol and Proof of Temporal Persistence remain an experiment in economic design, one I hope to implement when time and resources allow.   The mathematics have been carefully developed and the simulations run thousands of times, but the true test lies in whether individuals and communities will choose renewal, flow, and life over accumulation, comfort, and stasis. With this paper, the theoretical framework is complete; only practical implementation awaits. My hope is that, in creating value which must move to exist, we might discover economics that prioritize continual renewal of value, mirroring living systems and benefiting all instead of the few. The mathematics of decay could become the foundation for sustainable abundance, but only real-world deployment will reveal if theory translates to practice.  G   Acknowledgments  This work stands on the shoulders of giants. Deep gratitude to my family and friends who provided both emotional support and critical feed- back through countless iterations. Your patience with my obsession over decay rates and biological metaphors exemplifies the human connections that make any economic system worthwhile. The protocol builds upon decades of groundbreaking work in cryptography and distributed systems. I acknowledge the cypherpunks [21] who first envisioned private digital cash when such ideas seemed impossible. The zero-knowledge research community [13] transformed privacy from policy to mathematics, making health verification without surveillance achievable.   Bitcoin [24] demonstrated programmable scarcity.   Ethereum [8] generalized blockchain computation.   The broader ecosystem continues advancing human freedom through code. I learned a lot from researchers and writers like Dawkins [9], Ostrom [25], von Neumann [27], and from reading far too many papers instead of sleeping. They didn’t endorse this work, but their ideas made it possible to approach health and economics differently. And to OpenAI and Anthropic for their AI language models, which served as tireless intellectual companions, helping bridge evolutionary biology, cryptographic theory, and economic modeling while enabling rigorous mathematical formalization and technical validation. Thank you all. 32H   Adversarial Stress Test  Methodology  To test protocol resilience, a Monte Carlo simulation was run with 10,000 users over 365 days. Twenty-three percent of users were assigned adversarial behaviors intended to maximize wealth concentration and increase the Gini coefficient. Eight attack strategies were implemented, including sybil swarm formation, passive hoarding, coordinated collusion, periodic burst activity, churn- based exploitation, whale concentration, front-run transfers, and composite adaptive attacks. All simulation parameters (decay, activity rate, whale decay thresholds) matched those in the main experiments.  Results  Despite sustained adversarial activity, the protocol demonstrated significant resistance to inequality amplification. Table 7: Summary of Adversarial Stress Test Outcomes  Condition   Final Gini Coefficient   Interpretation  Baseline (clean)   0.33   Equitable equilibrium Adversarial (23%)   0.55   Moderate inequality, system robust US Dollar   0.82   Pathological inequality Bitcoin   0.88   Pathological inequality The highest Gini observed at initialization was 0.63, reflecting initial distribution noise. At one year, the system stabilized at a Gini of 0.55 which is higher than baseline, but well below traditional currencies and cryptocurrencies. Sybil swarms produced the wealthiest individual accounts, but failed to generate runaway in- equality.   All other attack vectors, including passive hoarding and collusive pooling, were limited by the protocol’s decay mechanics and progressive whale decay. Hoarding and inactivity consistently led to rapid value loss, demonstrating that “money must move” is a structural property.  Mechanisms of Robustness  Three protocol mechanisms proved decisive: 1.   Universal decay:   Exponential decay applies to all balances, regardless of strategy or iden- tity. 2.   Progressive whale decay:   Accumulated balances experience accelerated decay, capping potential for dominance. 3.   Activity coupling:   Reward accrual remains inseparable from continuous participation; pas- sive or cyclical exploit attempts are self-limiting. 33Conclusion  Adversarial simulation confirms that no known strategy can meaningfully circumvent enforced decay and activity requirements. Even with coordinated attacks and sybil formations, the protocol maintained Gini coefficients below those observed in all major legacy and digital monetary systems. This outcome validates the protocol’s core claim that value must circulate to persist, and attempts to evade circulation lead only to accelerated loss.  I   On the Irreversibility of Health Value Conversion  Conversion between token species is not permitted within the Autophage Protocol. Each token species, Rhythm, Healing, Foundation, and Catalyst, functions as a discrete record of a particular kind of health persistence.   The protocol is intentionally designed to make these categories non-fungible because doing so serves as a structural assertion about how value should reflect real-world persistence. Allowing conversion between tokens would erode the biological foundation of the protocol, making it possible to “farm” one domain of health for rewards in another.   In practice, such a mechanism would create arbitrage opportunities, invite speculation, and undermine the protocol’s core behavioral incentives. Metabolic activity is not inherently fungible; cardiovascular endurance cannot be traded for vaccine immunity, and emotional recovery cannot be converted into daily exercise. Proof of Temporal Persistence is defined by the activity that generates each token.   If a user wishes to hold more Foundation tokens, they must engage in preventive care; to increase Healing tokens, they must participate in therapy or recovery.   The marketplace allows users to monetize verified actions or proofs, but does not flatten the specific metabolic history those proofs represent. Catalyst tokens serve as the protocol’s primary “liquidity” vector for governance and marketplace functions, but are not a substitute for sustained health actions in any other domain. This irreversibility anchors the protocol to the realities of biology, closing the door to specula- tive gamesmanship and ensuring that economic rewards remain tethered to real, verifiable health persistence. Each token is a distinct receipt for a unique kind of effort and persistence. If you want Foundation, you must do the work.
